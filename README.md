# I carefully had to look over the designs we were 
given and decided to implement the design done by 
Abimbola,I chatted up the designer and we spoke on 
how the site was done and how the layout should look 
like on pc and mobile view.
# The site was done with only html and css since there
was no functionality for the site.
 # I had a lot of challenges during this project where 
 I had to put an image and it wasnâ€™t showing up. 
 Getting the site to be responsive was a really big 
 challenge cause I had to think of ways to get it 
 done cause my skills in responsiveness isn't perfect yet.
